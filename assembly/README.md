# Assembly Interpreter
This project entails a basic memory and a command-driven input method that lets you type in an instruction in pseudo-assembly, akin to the instruction set of the Little Man Computer model, and see it affect the accumulator and memory as you command.
The project is self-documenting, with all the help required to make use of the commands available in the `instructions.html` page.
